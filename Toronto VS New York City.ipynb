(15 marks)\nBoth New York City and the city of Toronto are the financial siginificant city of their respective countries,\nBoth cities are very diverse and are the financial capitals of their respective countries. One interesting idea would be to compare the neighborhoods of the two cities and determine how similar or dissimilar they are. Is New York City more like Toronto or Paris or some other multicultural city? I will leave it to you to refine this idea."
