A virus that was currently spreading across the world, majorly in China. The genomic sequencing has shown that the coronavirus is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA coronavirus.It has been confirmed that it primarily spreded by Human-to-human transmission and spread through close contact, in particular from coughs and sneezes within a range of about 6 feet. It is possible that the virus can be infectious even during the incubation period, that might explain why the outbreak has so much population get infected in China. \nHow do we utilize the current data to get more information about what we need to make this outbreak become better?"

The dataset includes few features like below: 'Province/State', 'Country/Origin', \"Number of Confirmed Cases', 'Number of Cured','Latitude' and 'Longitude'.The report will be interested in 5 variables: date, number of infected, fatalities and cured in a given region, and 'Country/Origin'."
